## üìå API Endpoints  

### üîπ **Legacies**  

| **Method** | **Endpoint** | **Description** |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **POST** | `/legacies` | Creates a new legacy. |
| **GET** | `/legacies/last/{user}` | Retrieves the last legacy of a user. |
| **POST** | `/legacies/{id}/sign` | Retrieves the signature payload for a legacy. |
| **PATCH** | `/legacies/{id}/sign` | Signs a legacy with a Web3 signature. |
| **POST** | `/legacies/{id}/execute` | Executes a legacy. |
| **POST** | `/legacies/{id}/stake` | Stakes the legacy funds via StakeKit. |
| **POST** | `/legacies/{id}/withdraw` | Withdraws all available funds. |
| **GET** | `/legacies/{id}/balance` | Retrieves the balance of a legacy in StakeKit. |

---

## üíé **StakeKit Integration**  

### üîπ **Stake (POST /legacies/{id}/stake)**  

This endpoint sends the legacy funds to **StakeKit** for staking.

#### **Process Flow:**  
1. Retrieve the investment wallet.  
2. Identify the **StakeKit integration** based on the **chain** and **token**.  
3. Execute the `enter` action in **StakeKit**.  
4. **Build and sign** the on-chain transaction.  
5. Submit the transaction and **monitor until confirmation**.  

#### **Example Response:**  

```json
{
  "status": "staked successfully",
  "transaction_url": "https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x123..."
}
```

---

### üîπ **Withdraw (POST /legacies/{id}/withdraw)**  

This endpoint **executes all pending actions** related to a wallet's **stake balance** in **StakeKit**.

#### **Process Flow:**  
1. Retrieve the **legacy balance**.  
2. Identify **all pending actions** such as unstaked funds, claim rewards, and withdrawals.  
3. Execute each **pending action** accordingly.  
4. **Build and sign transactions**.  
5. Submit transactions and **monitor until confirmation**.  

#### **Example Response:**  

```json
[
  {
    "groupId": "83edaa5c-1037-5bb6-b883-d3534d6a1faa",
    "status": "WITHDRAW successfully executed",
    "transaction_url": "https://etherscan.io/tx/0x123..."
  }
]

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **StakeKit Transaction Flow**  

Each **StakeKit operation** follows a structured **transaction execution flow**, ensuring consistency across all actions:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Post Action** ‚Üí Sends the request to **StakeKit** to initiate the action.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Get Current Gas** ‚Üí Retrieves current gas prices to optimize transactions.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Construct Transaction** ‚Üí Builds the raw unsigned transaction.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Sign Transaction** ‚Üí Signs the transaction with the investment wallet's **private key**.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Submit Transaction** ‚Üí Submits the signed transaction to the **blockchain**.  
6Ô∏è‚É£ **Get Transaction Status** ‚Üí Monitors the transaction **until confirmation**.  

üîπ This transaction flow is used for the following actions:  

| **Action** | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| **Stake (Enter)** | Deposits funds into a staking position. |
| **Unstake (Exit)** | Starts the unstaking process. |
| **Withdraw** | Moves claimed funds back to the user's wallet. |
