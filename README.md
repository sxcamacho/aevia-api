| **GET** | `/legacies/last/{user}` | Retrieves the last legacy of a user. |
| **POST** | `/legacies/{id}/sign` | Retrieves the signature payload for a legacy. |
| **PATCH** | `/legacies/{id}/sign` | Signs a legacy with a Web3 signature. |
| **POST** | `/legacies/{id}/execute` | Executes a legacy. |
| **POST** | `/legacies/{id}/stake` | Stakes the legacy funds via StakeKit. |

## üíé **StakeKit Integration**  

### üîπ **Stake (POST /legacies/{id}/stake)**  

This endpoint sends the legacy funds to **StakeKit** for staking.

#### **Process Flow:**  
1. Retrieve the investment wallet.  
2. Identify the **StakeKit integration** based on the **chain** and **token**.  
3. Execute the `enter` action in **StakeKit**.  
4. **Build and sign** the on-chain transaction.  
5. Submit the transaction and **monitor until confirmation**.  

#### **Example Response:**  

```json
{
  "status": "staked successfully",
  "transaction_url": "https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x123..."
}
```

---

### üîπ **Claim (POST /legacies/{id}/claim)**  

This endpoint executes a **claim** action in **StakeKit**, reclaiming:  

- **Unstaked funds** (`CLAIM_UNSTAKED`)  
- **Staking rewards** (`CLAIM_REWARDS`)  

#### **Process Flow:**  
1. Retrieve the **legacy balance**.  
2. Identify **unstaked funds** and **staking rewards**.  
3. Execute the `CLAIM_UNSTAKED` action (if unstaked funds are available).  
4. Execute the `CLAIM_REWARDS` action (if rewards are available).  
5. **Build and sign transactions**.  
6. Submit transactions and **monitor until confirmation**.  

#### **Example Response:**  

```json
{
  "status": "Claim process completed"
}
```

---

### üîπ **Withdraw (POST /legacies/{id}/withdraw)**  

This endpoint **withdraws** all available funds from **StakeKit** (`WITHDRAW_ALL`).  

#### **Process Flow:**  
1. Retrieve the **legacy balance**.  
2. Identify funds ready for withdrawal (`claimed`).  
3. Execute the `WITHDRAW_ALL` action in **StakeKit**.  
4. **Build and sign the transaction**.  
5. Submit the transaction and **monitor until confirmation**.  

#### **Example Response:**  

```json
{
  "status": "Withdraw process completed"
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **StakeKit Transaction Flow**  

Each **StakeKit operation** follows a structured **transaction execution flow**, ensuring consistency across all actions:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Post Action** ‚Üí Sends the request to **StakeKit** to initiate the action.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Get Current Gas** ‚Üí Retrieves current gas prices to optimize transactions.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Construct Transaction** ‚Üí Builds the raw unsigned transaction.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Sign Transaction** ‚Üí Signs the transaction with the operator's **private key**.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Submit Transaction** ‚Üí Submits the signed transaction to the **blockchain**.  
6Ô∏è‚É£ **Get Transaction Status** ‚Üí Monitors the transaction **until confirmation**.  

üîπ This transaction flow is used for the following actions:  

| **Action** | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| **Stake (Enter)** | Deposits funds into a staking position. |
| **Unstake (Exit)** | Starts the unstaking process. |
| **Claim (Unstaked & Rewards)** | Collects available rewards and unstaked funds. |
| **Withdraw** | Moves claimed funds back to the user's wallet. |
